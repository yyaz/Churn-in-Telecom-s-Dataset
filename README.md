# Churn-in-Telecom-s-Dataset
The dataset is the "Churn in Telecom's Dataset" found at https://www.kaggle.com/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset. The churn is commonly known as the discontinuing of the telecom service subscriptions. For a telecommunication service provider, being able to realize the factors behind churn is very important in order not to lose more subscribers. In this project, we will try to find which features most affect churn. The result of this project is a valuable insight for telecom operators in order to decrease their churn rates.
